Team Stats: 23,958 rows with boxscore stats from each game.
Player Stats: 305,732 rows with boxscore stats from each game.
While this kind of data can be found elsewhere on the internet, it is typically not in a format that allows for easy manipulation and analysis. The goal was to create a database that allows users to more easily perform statistical analysis and modeling.
